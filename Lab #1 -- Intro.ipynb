    "*** Introduction ***\n",
    "> In this lab, I will be using Seattle's 2018 wage data to determine a few things. I want to find the average salary of all of Seattle's employees, as well as the minimum and maximum wages. I'm specifically curious to see whether the mayor is Seattle's highest paid employee, as well as whether or not the lowest paid employee makes a legal salary. I want to see how much the city that I live in is spending on paying its employees, which is important, because my family along with many others pay taxes. Everyone should have the ability to know where the taxes that they are paying are going."

Then, I looped through every other element, and in that element, I replaced it with a version where the commas had been replaced with spaces. I then modified the initial 'content' buffer to be a variable that stores the new values, where each element is joined with a separating comma. Of course, I wanted to ignore the initial value (indicated with '[1:]'), because the first value is the column titles."
